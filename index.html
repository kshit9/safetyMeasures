Safety Precautions</h1>
<h2>
Tiger
</h2>
<p>Try to remain calm and back away slowly. In the event that a tiger is tracking you or has begun to snarl at you
and seems ready to attack, try to stay calm. Do not look the tiger in the eye, but do turn towards the tiger. Back
away slowly while fighting the urge to turn your back and run. [1]
Make yourself big. Try to look and feel brave. Whatever you do, do not run. Running away from a tiger is all
but inviting it to attack you.
Avoid inadvertently challenging a tiger’s mark. Stated otherwise, don’t pee in a tiger’s domain.
Wear a two-faced mask. Even when tigers have been observed stalking humans, they do not attack people
wearing a two-faced mask.
Attempt to distract the tiger and hide. Tigers are not as capable of climbing as are some other jungle cats, so
climb a tree until you can escape.
Repel an attacking tiger with noise. Even simple sounds may frighten a tiger off if they are not accustomed to
the noise. Make noise with anything you have, especially if it makes a loud or unnatural sound.
</p>
<h2>
Leopard
</h2>
<p>
Stay away from Cubs Don’t approach them too closely, especially if you see cubs. If they’re on their own,
don’t take any chances, because the mother could return at any moment, and bear in mind her sense of smell is
very powerful, and she’ll likely be aware of your presence long before you&#39;re aware of hers.
Don’t Run &amp; Keep yourself big If you are confronted by a charging leopard, don’t run, try to bluff your way
out of the attack by clapping your hands or waving your hands, basically do anything that will make you appear
bigger.
</p>
<h2>
Elephant
</h2>
<p>
Stay downwind of the elephant at all times. This way, the elephant will find it difficult to smell you and seek
you out (elephants have a keen sense of smell). If you can hide downwind, you might be able to avoid any
further encounter. If you do run, stay downwind to make following you more difficult.
If the elephant appears to be making a mock charge, you have the option of standing absolutely still. The
problem with this is that it is very hard to do when an elephant is bearing down on you. It does show the
elephant that you&#39;re non-threatening and it removes the desire to chase you. However, you&#39;ll need to judge the
suitability of this move by the size and aggressiveness of the elephant before you.
Be noisy. You can also shake trees, rattle bags, make noise using whatever objects are to hand.
A loudly and repetitively shouted &quot;No&quot; is good if you can&#39;t think of anything else.
Do not show your back to the elephant. Do not turn or run! Running encourages chasing. 
If you must run, try to do it in a way that deceives the elephant. A charging elephant can run much faster
than you but if you zig-zag, you might be able to confuse it. Elephants find it difficult to change directions due
to their bulky size. And, of course, run as fast as you can––your life depends on it.
Climb. Elephants can&#39;t climb, obviously. And provided you find a sturdy enough tree of good height, it might be

enough to put space between you and the marauding elephant. Keep in mind that the elephant might rip the tree
down, so be on the lookout for signs that it might try this next.
Don’t Swim Be warned! It might not be wise to jump into water. Apart from the fact that the water might
harbor other non-friendly wildlife, elephants are surprisingly good swimmers and it may decide to simply follow
you.
</p>
<h2>
Bear
</h2>
<p>
Make noise while you walk. Clapping your hands, singing, ringing bells, or speaking loudly 
Carry bear pepper spray. This should be your first line of defense if a bear attacks. It creates a large cloud that
will usually stop a bear in its tracks.
If attacked by a bear, do not run. The bear will think you are prey and will chase you.
Do not climb a tree. Black bears are excellent climbers.
If a bear touches you, drop to the ground and play dead. Lie on your stomach, clasp your hands behind your
neck, and use your elbows and toes to avoid being rolled over. If the bear does roll you, keep rolling until you
land back on your stomach. Stay still and do not struggle or scream. A defensive bear will stop attacking once it
feels you are not a threat. Do not move until you are absolutely sure the bear has left the area.
Be scentless. Bears are attracted by smells, so use fragrance-free shampoos and soaps. Insect-repelling citronella
candles actually can attract bears.
</p>



<h2>
Rhino
</h2>

<p>
Don’t Misunderstand them Rhinos can cover 30m, accelerating from 0-55kmph, in just three seconds - do not
make the mistake of thinking them heavy and slow. They will come at you flat out.
Don’t panic and run- you cannot outpace a rhino. And, if you are in a group, don’t scatter, try to stick
together. Make an escape plan before you approach and stick to it.
Rhinos use all of their senses-hearing and smell, and though they cannot see well, they can detect movement.
Make sure your escape tree is sturdy enough – a furious rhino may simply push down a smaller tree.
Rhinos may be colour blind but they react to red and white so avoid wearing these colours.
</p>

<h2>
Lion
</h2>

<p>
Do not run Stand your ground .You need to take charge of the situation and show the lion that you’re a threat.
Turn so that you reside-on- side with the lion while clapping your hands, shouting and waving your arms. This
will make you appear bigger and threatening to the lion.
Retreat slowly Do not turn your back. Keep flailing your arms and showing, but slowly step away sideways.
Show yourself bigger Raise your hand and try to show yourself bigger and keep shouting.
